# Lightning Datatable with Pagination
### Salesforce Lightning Component

This is a sample Salesforce Lightning Application customizing the [`lightning:datatable`](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/bundle/lightning:datatable/example). This simple app has a `lightning:datatable` with 3 pages, getting data dynamically for every pagination and selectable rows with memory on every page.
